name: 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2.0T
description: Build Synopsis  - Built Engine With JE Forged Pistons, Brian Crower
  H-Beam Rods, ARP Headstuds and Main Studs  - All new OEM Timing Components and
  Seals  - BC Racing BR Series Coilovers  - Cosmis 18" Wheels with Falken Azenis
  Tires   - ISR Catback Exhaust System     This car came to us after the
  customer bought it knowing it would need an engine. Once we got the car in the
  shop and got the engine out we found fire damage near the firewall as well as
  multiple holes in the engine block from a connecting rod failing and spinning
  around. This build started off with a good condition used engine that we
  sourced and tore down for inspection before having machine work done and
  rebuilding the engine with all the upgraded components. The car also got a
  beautiful ISR Stainless Steel catback exhaust system to go with the BC Racing
  coilovers and Cosmis wheels.   This car is currently on a stock turbo with
  very minor power upgrades but will be getting a top mount turbo upgrade, fuel
  system upgrades, Haltech ECU and more very soon! We can't wait to see what the
  car will do!
